# Toaster

This component renders all the toasts, you can place it anywhere in your app.

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">Ensure there is only 1 `Toaster` component rendered in your app at all times</Callout>


## Customization

You can see examples of most of the scenarios described below on the [homepage](/).

### Expand

When you hover on one of the toasts, they will expand. You can make that the default behavior by setting the `expand` prop to `true`, and customize it even further with the `visibleToasts` prop.

```jsx
// 9 toasts will be visible instead of the default, which is 3.
<Toaster expand visibleToasts={9} />
```

### Position

Changes the place where all toasts will be rendered.

```jsx
// Available positions:
// top-left, top-center, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-center, bottom-right
<Toaster position="top-center" />
```

### Styling all toasts

You can customzie all toasts at once with `toastOptions` prop. These options will act as the default for all toasts.

```jsx
<Toaster
  toastOptions={{
    alertSx: {
        backgroundColor: "red",
    },
  }}
/>
```
Check out the [styling](/styling) documentation for all available options.

### dir

Changes the directionality of the toast's text.

```jsx
// rtl, ltr, auto
<Toaster dir="rtl" />
```
