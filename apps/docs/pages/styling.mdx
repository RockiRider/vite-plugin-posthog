# Styling

Styling can be done in a few different ways. We will run through all the options here.

## Styling with the MUI Theme
Styling can be done globally via the MUI theme. This way every toast will have the same styling.

MUI lets you target the different variants of the toast, so you can style them differently. 

For example you can style all the filled success toasts to have a red background color.

```jsx
const theme = createTheme({
    components: {
        MuiAlert: {
            styleOverrides: {
                filledSuccess: {
                    backgroundColor: "red",
                },
            },
        },
    },
});
```
 
<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">This will change the styling of all the `Alert` components in your app, not just the toasts.</Callout>

Check out the [MUI documentation](https://mui.com/customization/theming/) for more information on theming.

- [AlertTitle](https://mui.com/material-ui/api/alert-title/)

## Styling with the Toaster

Styling can be done globally via `toastOptions`, this way every toast will have the same styling. 
- You can style the `Alert` component for all toasts
- You can style the `CloseButton` `ActionButton` and `Description` for all different types of toasts.

```jsx
<Toaster
  toastOptions={{
    alertSx: {
        backgroundColor: "red",
    },
    success:{
        closeButtonSx: {
            color: "red",
        }
        actionButtonSx: {
            color: "red",
        }
        descriptionSx: {
            color: "red",
        }  
    },
    loading:{
        closeButtonSx: {
            color: "red",
        }
        actionButtonSx: {
            color: "red",
        }
        descriptionSx: {
            color: "red",
        }  
    }
    // ... and so on
  }}
/>
```
## Styling with the toast
You can also use the same props when calling `toast` to style a specific toast.

```jsx
toast('Hello World', {
});
```

## Changing Icons

You can change the default icons using the `toasterOptions` on the `Toaster` component. This will change the default icons for all toasts, for their respective toast types.

```jsx
<Toaster
  toasterOptions={{
    success: {
        icon: <SuccessIcon/>
    },
    info: {
        icon: <InfoIcon/>
    },
    // ... and so on
  }}
/>
```

You can also set an icon for each toast:

```jsx
toast('Hello World', {
  icon: <Icon />,
});
```

You can also set a toast to hide the icon:

```jsx
toast('Hello World', {
  hideIcon: true,
});
```
